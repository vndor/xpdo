## Contributing

Hi there! Thanks for considering a contribution to vndor/xpdo. We'd be glad to have your help with this project!

Here are a few guidelines to follow when preparing your contribution or creating an issue.

## Creating Issues
If you find bugs, or want feature improvements, please create a GitHub issue. 

For bugs, please include what you did, what happened, and what should have happened. This helps us figure out the cause
and fix it.

For feature improvements, please explain what you want to do, what you want to happen, and why you think this would be a
good addition to the library (over, say, a plugin you write for your own use). 

## Submitting Patches

Patches are always welcome. Patches from contributors is the foundation of open source!

We use PHPUnit as our testing framework. You can see examples of tests in the tests/ directory.

In addition, please conform your code to the PSR standards. 
Our code build process will break if your code does not conform to this standard, and we may be able to not accept your patch. 

Thank you for your contribution!
